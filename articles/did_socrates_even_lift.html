There is a somewhat well-known quote attributed to Socrates:
<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5hcclh/did_socrates_even_lift/dazuvb7/">No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.</blockquote>
Of course, the actual historical context makes it likely that the quote was intended to have a more complex interpretation than a simple endorsement of getting ripped. The title of this post is inspired by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5hcclh/did_socrates_even_lift/dazuvb7/">reddit thread discussing the above quote</a>. TLDR version: Socrates (or Xenophon, inserting his own views into Socrates' mouth) was probably more concerned with the idea that a fit man would be able to survive wars, and simultaneously admonishing the Athenian state for not doing state-funded military training (in contrast to the training program of Sparta, their rival in the Peloponnesian War). For those interested, see the more accurately translated version in its full context here: <a href="http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Xen.%20Mem.%203.12">Xenophon, <em>Memorabilia</em> 3.12</a>
<br><br>
Personally, I think we can take the spirit of the somewhat misinterpreted quote and turn it into something much more relevant to current civilization:
<blockquote cite="https://kunlizhan.com/?post/did_socrates_even_lift" style="font-size: 1.5em;">No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of intellectual pursuit. It is a shame for a man to die without realizing the creativity and power of which his mind is capable.</blockquote>
I often wonder why many humans seem to stop their philosophical pondering as they grow into adulthood. Many kids ask:
<br><br>"Why is __ like that?"
<br>"Where did I come from?" and more importantly,
<br>"Where did my parents, and their parents, and their parents times infinity come from?"
<br>"How did the world start?"
<br>"How big is the universe?"
<br><br>
12-year-old me would have blamed religion for some of this. That somehow telling people "God created the world" got them to stop asking the obvious next question.
<br><br>
But now I think that many people actually just lose their curiosity as they stop being a child. (Because of course, "God is uncaused and eternal" won't satisfy a mind actually curious.) I know many adults who aren't creationists or care about religion. If you asked them something non-controversial and apolitical like "how big is the universe?", they would not be able to tell you. But worse than that: they didn't just forget, they never even bothered looking it up.
<br><br>
If you don't think that is strange, try very hard to imagine being 6 years old again. Of course you'd want to know how big the world is! To not be curious about that is what is actually fucking unimaginable!
<br><br>
And yet, many people who don't care about creationism at all, also don't care to research the fascinating story of cosmological history or human evolution.
<br><br>
I am at a loss for words, except for one: why???
<br><br>
Of course, I think I mostly know why. Or at least what they would say. "There are many more practical things to worry about," they would say. Like your next job interview. Or your taxes this year. Or even something "bigger" than yourself, like a political movement. These things are all true, but I don't think they are enough to explain why they aren't curious. Because they have time to relax at the end of the day, and instead of learning something important about existence itself, they choose to watch some re-run of their favourite show for the 11th time.
<br><br>
Would your 6-year-old self let these things get in the way of learning about where the edge of the world is, <em>indefinitely?</em> I don't think so. Okay, so maybe mommy doesn't have time to tell me now, but I'll ask again after dinner. And if that fails, ask again tomorrow. That's what 6-year-old you would do.
<br><br>
So my current stance is this: many people unknowingly lose their curiosity. And it is such a shame. A great, unmourned, tragedy. Sure, I myself will sometimes prioritize day-to-day chores to reading blog posts about philosophy. But that's because I can reasonably expect to live long enough to read them after I finish the chores. I don't think the kind of people I've been ranting about are merely planning to read later. If they were on their deathbed, I don't think they would regret not learning cosmology, evolution, or mathematics.
<br><br>
To any soul, one's own existence is surely the most interesting phenomenon of all. I think it's strange that many seem to wander around life half-conscious. What's the point of acing that job interview, if you're never getting around to learning about the phenomenon that is your own existence? You want that job for the money you can spend on living while not really knowing what life is? Unbelievable.
<br><br>
No doubt, someone reading this may think that I'm being unbearably pretentious. "So this random person knows what life is, huh? Give me a fucking break."
<br><br>
Well yes, I'm being serious here. Someone who has thought about and studied the philosophical nature of minds and identity does seem to me to know more about what life is, compared to someone who never studied that. Would anyone also deny that humans generally know more about life than a dog or a cat? Most people educated in such philosophy are also too nice to say it so bluntly like that. Hell, I probably wouldn't say this in a face to face conversation with a stranger. Good thing this is the internet.
<br><br>
One of the most common questions a kid would ask, I think, is: "Why am I me, and not someone else?"
<br><br>
I have no idea why most adults seem to have stopped asking this question about identity. It can't be that they got the answer, because almost no one can attempt to answer this without demonstrating their own confusion on the matter. I'm not talking about some superficial way to dodge this question, such as intentionally misinterpreting it as "Why am I unique, different from other people?". No, I mean <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQEwySCcLtdKHkrHp/righting-a-wrong-question">"Why do I wake up in my body instead of someone else's?"</a> I hope that you, dear reader, will not cease to ponder this until you are satisfied. For it would be a shame for a mind to die before knowing this.
