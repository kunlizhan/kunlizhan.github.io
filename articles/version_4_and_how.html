It's been a while since I last made a post like this. Fun.
<br><br>
I built my first website with Flash in 2009. Sounds weird in 2020, right? Flash is being phased out everywhere, and no one wants to embed it as part of their site, let alone make their whole site out of it. Well, the world was different then. Seemed like a good idea at the time.
<br><br>
I can't remember if I ever finished that site. I think I did? I think this was what it looked like.
<img src="/img/full/old_site_0.jpg">
I call that one 'Version 0' because I can't remember if I actually finished it. A decade later, I no longer remember why I changed it to this:
<img src="/img/full/old_site_1.jpg">
I believe that is Version 1. I will never know why I made a newer version that looked worse. It is possible that I'm mixing these two up; I'm only going off of the time stamp on the last .swf files I have of these sites. I think one thing that prompted me to make Version 1 was to make a website that dynamically loaded new content (without having to go edit the flash file). That's something trivial with the proper web technology; in fact, I am writing this now in a separate text file, knowing exactly how I'll load it into my new website when I'm done. But yeah, I didn't know better; I was working in Flash. Back then, it felt like a pretty big accomplishment to me to write my first "Welcome to my new site!" post in an external text file and then have it show up in my Flash site. Anyways, perhaps Version 1 looks like that because I never fully finished it before moving to Version 2. Which looks even worse, but this time I'm sure it's because this is only a test version. I don't have the final version saved, unfortunately.
<img src="/img/full/old_site_2.jpg">
I do remember my goals for Version 2. The test version makes it pretty obvious. I wanted dynamic transitions between the different pages such as "News", "Contact", and "Gallery". You see, even from the very beginning, I had elaborate animations to mark the transitions between pages. In the prior versions, I had a transition animation going from the Home/Main/Root page to each of the sub-pages such as "Contact". From "Contact", one could only return to the "Home" page, as that would allow me to put a pre-set animation.
<br><br>
But of course this was crappy UI design; one couldn't go directly from one sub-page to another. Animation for page transitions are already frowned upon as a gratuitous show-off for web developers that real users hate, and while I was still determined to make quick yet flashy animations for my website because <em>I liked it</em>, I had no excuse to keep the hub-style UI logic. Instead of a hub it had to be a web; every page needed direct animation to every other. So the transition animation must be generated on the fly, unless I wanted to make a vast number of animations to cover all the combinations. With 6 pages (including Home), there would be 15 different transitions, and twice that number if the transitions were to be different when going from A to B compared to B to A.
<br><br>
In the test shown above, I was moving the ball around depending on which button the user clicked; the important thing was that it didn't matter where the ball currently is when they clicked; it could even be in the middle of another transition. This would be a proof-of-concept for page transitions; I'd simply replace the ball with a complex combination of moving other objects around.
<br><br>
Then in early 2015 I was about to graduate from Sheridan College's Bachelor's of Animation program. I needed a site to maximize first impressions with animation recruiters, and I didn't think my dark, show-offy Flash site was up to the task. As I was busy with the final project of making an animated film, I just chose a Wordpress template that looked good and went with it:
<img src="/img/full/old_site_3_01.jpg"> <img src="/img/full/old_site_3_02.jpg">
And I kept this for my relatively brief career (thus far) in animation. But as of this moment I have no need for a pure promotional site for my animation experience, and that old Wordpress template is experiencing code rot and is having more and more compatibility issues with newer versions of Wordpress and other web technologies. So here I am again, launching my personal site once more...
