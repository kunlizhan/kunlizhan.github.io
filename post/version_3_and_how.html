I do remember my goals for Version 2. The test version makes it pretty obvious. I wanted dynamic transitions between the the different pages such as "News", "Contact", and "Gallery". You see, even from the very beginning, I had elaborate animations to mark the transitions between pages. In the prior versions, I had a transition animation going from the Home/Main/Root page to each of the sub-pages such as "Contact". From "Contact", one could only return to the "Home" page, as that would allow me to put a pre-set animation. But of course this was crappy UI design; one couldn't go directly from one sub-page to another. Animation for page transitions are already frowned upon as a gratuitous show-off for web developers that real users hate, and while I was still determined to make quick yet flashy animations for my website because <em>I</em> liked it, I had no excuse to keep the hub-style UI logic. Instead of a hub it had to be a web; every page needed direct animation to every other. So the transition animation must be generated on the fly, unless I wanted to make a vast number of animations to cover all the combinations. With 6 pages (including Home), there would be 15 different transitions, and twice that number if the transitions were to be different when going from A to B compared to B to A. In the test shown here, I was moving the ball around dynamically depending on which button the user clicked; the important thing was that it didn't matter where the ball started when they clicked; it could even be in the middle of another transition. This would be a proof-of-concept for page transitions; I'd simply replace the ball with a complex combination of moving other objects around.
